Introdution 

GitHUb flow is a lightweight, brach-based workflow. The GitHub flow is useful for everyone, not just developers. Foe example, here at GitHub, we use
GitHub flow for our site policy, documentation, and roadmap.


Prerequisites

To follow GitHub flow, you will need GitHub account and a repository. For more information on how to create an account, see "Signing up for GitHUb".
For information on how to create a repository, see "Create a repo", For information on how to find an existing repository to contribute to, see 
"Finding ways to contribute to open soutce on GitHub".


Following GitHub flow.


Tip: You can complete all steps of GitHub through GitHub web interface, command line and GitHUb CLi, or GitHub Desktop.



Create a branch

Create a branch in your repository. A short, descriptive branch name enables you collaborators to see ongoing work at a glance. For example, 
increase-test-timeout or add-code-of-conduct. For more information, see "Creating and deleting branches within your repository"

By creating a branch, you create a space to work without affecting the default branch. Additionally, you give collaborators, a chanceto review your
work.

Make changes

On your branch, make any desired changes to the repository. For more information, see "Creating new files", "Editing files," "Ewnaming a file" " Moveing a file to
a new location", or "deleting files in a repository"

Your branch is a safe place to make changes. If you make a mistake, you can revert your changes or push additional changes to fix the mistake Your changes
will not end up on the default branch util you merge your branch.


Commit and push your changes to your branch. Give each commit a descriptive message to help you and future contributors understand what changes the commit contains.
For example, fix typo or increase rate limit.

Ideally, each commit contains an isolated, complete change. This makes it easy to revert your changes if you decide to take a different approach. For 
example, if you want to rename a variable and add sometests, put the variable rename in one commit and the tests in another commit. Later, if you want to keep the tests
put the variable rename in one commit and the tests in another commit. Later, if you want to keep the tests but revert
